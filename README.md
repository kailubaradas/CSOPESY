## How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Run the Executable Directly
1. Make sure `main.exe` is present in this folder.
2. Double-click `main.exe` or run it from the command prompt:
   ```cmd
   main.exe
   ```

### Option 2: Use the Provided Batch File
1. Make sure `main.exe` is present in this folder.
2. Double-click `run.bat` or run it from the command prompt:
   ```cmd
   run.bat
   ```

This will execute the program as intended.

If you need to recompile `main.cpp`, use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
```cmd
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
```
