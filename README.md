## How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Use the Provided Batch File (Recommended)
1. Make sure you have `g++` (MinGW or similar) installed and added to your PATH.
2. Double-click `run.bat` or run it from the command prompt:
   ```cmd
   run.bat
   ```
   This will compile `main.cpp` and then run the resulting `main.exe`.

### Option 2: Compile and Run Manually
1. Make sure you have `g++` installed and added to your PATH.
2. Open a command prompt in this folder and run:
   ```cmd
   g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
   main.exe
   ```

**Note:**
- The `main.exe` file is not included in the repository. You must compile it yourself using the instructions above.
- If you encounter any errors, ensure that your C++ compiler is properly installed and accessible from the command line.
